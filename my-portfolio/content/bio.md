I’m a student at Duke University majoring in Computer Science with a strong interest in innovation, design, and AI.  
I enjoy building projects that combine technology and creativity — from web apps and research tools to interactive data experiences.  
Over the past few years, I’ve worked on projects involving machine learning, React, and cloud technologies.  
I’m passionate about solving real problems, learning continuously, and collaborating with people who love to build meaningful things.
